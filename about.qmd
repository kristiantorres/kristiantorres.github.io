<!-- ![Profile Image](kristian_pro.jpeg) -->

I am a research geophysicist at <a href="https://dug.com/" target="_blank">DUG</a>, specializing in Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI). Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in Geophysics at the University of Alberta (UofA) :canada:, where I conducted research under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~msacchi/" target="_blank">Prof. Mauricio Sacchi</a>. My Ph.D. research focused on developing deep-learning tools for solving inverse problems in seismic imaging and signal processing.

Before finishing my Ph.D. and joining DUG, I earned a B.S. (2015) in geophysical engineering from Simon Bolivar University :venezuela: and an M.S. (2019) in computational geophysics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro :brazil:.

My expertise includes:

* Inverse problems
* Deep learning and scientific machine learning
* Seismic imaging and full-waveform inversion
* Signal processing
* HPC
