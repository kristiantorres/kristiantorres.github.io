<!-- ![Profile Image](kristian_pro.jpeg) -->

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Geophysics at the University of Alberta (UofA). I conduct research under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~msacchi/" target="_blank">Prof. Mauricio Sacchi</a> that focuses on developing deep-learning tools for solving inverse problems in seismic imaging and signal processing.

Before coming to the UofA :canada: , I received a B.S. (2015) in geophysical engineering from Simon Bolivar University :venezuela: and an M.S. (2019) in computational geophysics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro :brazil:.

My current research topics include:

* Inverse problems
* Deep learning and scientific machine learning
* Seismic imaging and full-waveform inversion
* Signal processing
* HPC

## Updates
* May, 2023: I chaired the machine learning session at the Geoconvention this year :chair:. I also presented my recent work on deep learning synthetizers for LSM in the seismic imaging and FWI session.

* Apr, 2023: Our paper on nullspace networks for reflectivity inversion was accepted for publication on <a href="https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2478.13366" target="_blank">Geophysical Prospecting</a>. :fire:

* Mar, 2023: I accepted an internship offer from Halliburton Landmark. I will be workig as a Geophysics intern in spring/summer 2023. :office:

* Feb, 2023: I have been awarded the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/graduate-studies/awards-and-funding/scholarships/ab-innovates/ai-graduate-student-scholarship.html" target="_blank">Alberta Innovates Scholarship</a>. :muscle: 

* Feb, 2023: I gave a talk at TGS on "Deep learning applications for seismic imaging".

* Jan, 2023: I gave several presentations at [SAIG sponsors meeting](https://saig.physics.ualberta.ca/doku.php?id=publications:annualreports:saig_23p){target="_blank"}.

* Oct, 2022: I passed my PhD candicay exam!	:beers:
