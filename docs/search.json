Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in Geophysics at the University of Alberta (UofA) 🇨🇦, where I conducted research under the guidance of Prof. Mauricio Sacchi. My Ph.D. research focused on developing deep-learning tools for solving inverse problems in seismic imaging and signal processing.\nBefore finishing my Ph.D. and joining DUG, I earned a B.S. (2015) in geophysical engineering from Simon Bolivar University 🇻🇪 and an M.S. (2019) in computational geophysics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro 🇧🇷.\nMy expertise includes:"

Below is an example with real post-stack data.\n\n\n\nSparse vector reflectivity FWLSRTM\nI developed and showcased Sparse Full-wavefield LSRTM, which redefines the variable-density acoustic wave equation using vector reflectivity. This method efficiently captures a broader range of seismic events, ensuring a superior fit for complex datasets and delivering high-resolution outcomes via sparse pre-stack seismic inversion. \n\n\nReflection waveform inversion\nSpecial flavor of FWI that exploits the tenuous low-wavenumber 🐰 reflection kernel to recover a macro velicity model from reflection data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nImaging with Right and left deep-learning preconditioners\nAccelerating seismimc imaging through deep neural networks trained from migrated and re-migrated data/models to avoid dependance on unavailable ground-truth labels while roughly approximating the inverse Hessian and data resolution matrices.  \n\n\nExtended-domain LSRTM\nI developed a Python/Fortran package focused on extended-domain (e.g., subsurface-offset, angle, time-shift, shot and receiver) imaing and inversion.\n \n\n\nPlane-wave FD\nExamples with acoustic and elastic media.
