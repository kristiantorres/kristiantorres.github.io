I conduct research under the guidance of Prof. Mauricio Sacchi that focuses on developing deep-learning tools for solving inverse problems in seismic imaging and signal processing.\nBefore coming to the UofA 🇨🇦 , I received a B.S. (2015) in geophysical engineering from Simon Bolivar University 🇻🇪 and an M.S. (2019) in computational geophysics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro 🇧🇷.\nMy current research topics include:"
